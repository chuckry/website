Node.js
http://nodejs.org/download/

Node.js is able to create a web server that functions similarly to a locally hosted environment. 
Running: php -S 0.0.0.0:9900 from public/ functions the same as running: nodejs node/server.js.
This server is highly flexible and very simple to write and expand, allowing for easily moving forward.
