Node.js
http://nodejs.org/download/

Node.js is able to create a web server that functions similarly to a locally hosted environment. 
Running: php -S 0.0.0.0:9900 from public/ functions the same as running: nodejs node/server.js.
This server is highly flexible and very simple to write and expand, allowing for easily moving forward.

Run the compiled version from top level directory with: ./node/nodejs node/server.js
If this executable doesn't work on your system, please inform Dom or post your computer info here in the readme:
