		<h4>Section 2: Rush</h4>
		<p>1. At the beginning of the fall and winter semesters, a Membership Committee, managed by the Membership Chair, will arrange advertising, informational sessions, events, and applications for potential members.</p>
		<p>2. Rush will begin with informational sessions that provide an overview of the fraternity to interested students. There will be two to four sessions held at the beginning of each semester.</p>
		<p>3. To become acquainted with potential members, three events will be held for any students interested in becoming active members. The events will be determined by the Membership Committee and attendance will be kept to verify interview eligibility. Failure to attend an event or notify the Membership Chair of an absence will result in interview ineligibility.</p>
		<p>4. After attending an informational session, all students interesting in becoming members of Kappa Theta Pi must fill out an application to acquire clerical information and a summary of their interests.</p>
