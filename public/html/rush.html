<!-- no need to include jquery loads here:
	a) loading a js framework from an http address requires extra work for the client's browser
	b) we already have jquery-2.0.3 installed* in our framework -see ./public/vendor for installed frameworks
		*our server has its own copies of these files that we load in index.html, and any files loaded there can be used here
